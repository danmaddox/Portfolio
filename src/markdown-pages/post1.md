<!-- # My Journey -->
<!-- 
After finishing sixth form and not knowing where to go next, I eventually secured myself an administrator job within a nearby Office.
Starting out I had no transferable skills and a passionate hatred for numbers and Excel. As time went on this was revealed to me as nothing more than a lack of confidence and infamiliarity.

As time went on I developed my skills becoming an excel super user and having my first experiences of coding by dabbling around with VBA. The running of reports, supporting my team and working with CRM systems such as salesforce helped awaken within me an interest of data, technical process and reporting. Conveniently for me all of this went together to help secure me a job within a finance team supporting management accountants in various different areas. This is where I honed my skills eventually allowing me to progress into a business insights team as an Insights Analyst. From there I worked with a range of new tools such as Tableau, Alteryx, Databases and improved my understanding of higher level analysis.

During these experiences one thing I became frustrated with was lack of my own efficiency and ability to create my own technical solutions, this pushed me into the journey of coding. Initially I began working with Python for automation, ranging from everyday process to querying data from APIs also dabbling in various data libraries enhancing my analysis toolkit. I then took this a step further and began the journey into web development as I was truly amazed of the power of modern web applications and am excited to see how these transform the future of web. -->
